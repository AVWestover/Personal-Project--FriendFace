# Personal-Project--FriendFace
A full stack project using Java Spring Boot


FriendFace is a full stack personal project I made using Java Spring Boot. It is a small social media app where users can create logins, log in, create posts, view all posts by other users, view posts by an other user of their choice, delete their own posts, edit their own posts, and log out. The routes are secure using user_id sessions. Their are validations for user registration and user login. I did not spend a lot of time on the styling of this project, and instead focussed on functionality. 

The name "FriendFace" is a name used by the tv show The IT Crowd in season 3, episode 5. I do not claim ownership or rights to this name. It is merely a fun project I did to practice building full stack applications with Java Spring Boot, it is not meant for commercial use.
